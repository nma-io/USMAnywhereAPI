# USMAnywhereAPI
Some example code for using Alienvault USM Anywhere's New API functionality. 


Note:


This is not an SDK. Its just example code to get you started writing your own apps.

I just couldn't find any usable examples on Alienvault's site.

Go here first:

Then go here:

The Go code is really dirty. It works, but its ugly and I could use someone with more experience in JSON handling with Go to help me clean it up. 

Please submit pull requests.
